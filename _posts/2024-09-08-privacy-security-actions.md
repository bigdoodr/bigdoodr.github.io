The late Kevin Mitnick's book, Art of Invisibility, was released in 2017. I didn't read it until 2024. Though some of the topics covered were a little dated, the majority of them are quite relevant. While making my way through the book, I made a checklist of actions a person can take to enhance their digital privacy and security. Most suggestions are good, practical, and easy-to-implement actions. Others are rather drastic and don't necessarily apply to most folks that just want to safeguard their digital presence a little better. I've made a key to indicate what I think is the practicality of each suggestion. I'm also a big fan of Apple's iCloud<font size="3">⊕</font> service, and the Passwords app, and the security enhancements it offers, so I've indicated which items can be implemented through it.
