As a continuation of the actions an individual should take to enhance their privacy and security, one onus of a company/organization should be to protect both their employees' and their customers' / users' security & privacy and encourage those people to be mindful of their digital presence.

Also adapted from Kevin Mitnick's book, Art of Invisibility, below are items I think befalls on a good corporation to implement.

Ask yourself if your employeer does these things.

Consider what websites you patronize and if their data usage policies address these items.

To go really deep and reflect on how companies' IT Security should communicate with their employees, check out [honest.security](https://honest.security).
