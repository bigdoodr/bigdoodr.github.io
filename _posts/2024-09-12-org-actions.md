As a continuation of the actions an individual should take to enhance their privacy and security, one onus of a company/organization should be to protect both their employees' and their customers' / users' security & privacy and encourage those people to be mindful of their digital presence. Also adapted from Kevin Mitnick's book, Art of Invisibility, below are items I think befalls on a good corporation to implement. Ask yourself if your employeer does these things. Consider what websites you patronize and if their data usage policies address these items.

# Org Responsibilities to Employees and Customers

### Password and Authentication Management

Promote Strong Password Hygiene
: Require strong, unique passwords and encourage the use of password managers to securely store them.

Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
: Require MFA for accessing sensitive systems and data to add an extra layer of protection.

Utilize Passwordless Authentication
: Encourage secure alternatives such as biometric authentication for sensitive applications.
###  Encryption and Secure Communications

End-to-End Encryption
: Enforce encryption for all communications, including emails, messaging, and VoIP services.

Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
: Ensure sensitive data is always encrypted, whether stored locally or transmitted over networks.
### Network Security

Secure Wi-Fi and Network Traffic
: Use WPA3 or VPNs to secure connections and deploy firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor traffic.

Segment Networks
: Isolate IoT and less-secure devices from the core network to limit exposure in case of a breach.
### Device and Account Security

Enforce Device Security Policies
: Implement mandatory device locking, remote-wipe capabilities, and full-disk encryption on all company-issued devices.

Regular Software Updates
: Ensure timely updates to all devices, apps, and firmware to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Mobile Device Management (MDM)
: Use MDM solutions to enforce security policies, remotely wipe devices, and manage app usage.

Provide Privacy Controls
: Allow users to opt out of data collection and provide clear, transparent privacy policies regarding data handling.

### Security Awareness and Training

Conduct Regular Training
: Offer security awareness training on topics like phishing, social engineering, secure device handling, and safe online practices.

Simulated Security Drills
: Regularly conduct phishing simulations and other security exercises to test employee readiness.
### Secure Cloud and Backup Solutions

Encrypted Cloud Backup
: Ensure cloud backups are encrypted and regularly audited for compliance with security standards.

Control Cloud Access
: Implement strict permissions and two-factor authentication for cloud services to safeguard sensitive data.
### Incident Response and Auditing

Develop an Incident Response Plan
: Create a clear response plan for handling data breaches, including roles, communication protocols, and recovery steps.

Conduct Regular Audits
: Perform routine audits of security practices, data handling, and third-party vendor compliance.
### Physical and Environmental Security

Secure Devices Physically
: Encourage the use of cable locks and secure storage options for devices, particularly during travel or remote work.

Monitor and Control Physical Access
: Use secure printing and access controls for sensitive areas to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
