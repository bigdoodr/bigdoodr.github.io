# I Kissed Google Goodbye

> Full Disclosure: I have not fully disconnected from Google. And it's unlikely I ever will.

- I use YouTube TV. Other streaming services just don't compare to its offerings.
- A whole bunch of services are linked to my Gmail address. It's going to be a long hard road uncoupling 20-ish years' worth of systems that use an email address as both their sign-in username and contact method.
- And then there's YouTube--all the creators that interest me host their content on YouTube. There is Invidious, which I like and have been using for a while now--but it just pipes YouTube content over; not a true replacement. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## The Warning Signs

Some would say the writing has been on the wall for a while. I mostly ignored them, chalking up the naysayers as haters. But when [Timnit was fired for her collaborative research paper on AI's bias](https://web.archive.org/web/20201211061214/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/technology/google-researcher-timnit-gebru.html), I finally woke up.

I then started paying attention to how Google services I used/depended upon got worse:

- **Photos Storage** - I was a Pixel phone owner for a long time. A huge benefit of that was unlimited original quality photo storage for the original Pixel. Then Google changed it for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 3--both of those got [unlimited original quality photo storage for the first three years](https://web.archive.org/web/20210926142842/https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/04/pixel-2s-free-original-quality-google-photos-uploads-available-end-2020/) of ownership. In 2021, [both original quality and high quality started counting against storage](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111220306/https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/).
- **[Google Speakers lawsuit with Sonos](https://web.archive.org/web/20231002014910/https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871304/google-home-speaker-group-volume-control-changes-sonos-patent-decision)** - Google stole IP from another company. My speakers became less responsive over time, despite various resets/retrains.
- **[Google Scanning Private Photos and Incorrectly Reporting CSAM](https://web.archive.org/web/20240119181216/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/googles-scans-private-photos-led-false-accusations-child-abuse)** - AI-driven scanning of photos seemed beneficial, but after cases where innocent family photos were wrongly flagged, I started doubting Google’s handling of private data.
- **Chrome's Dubious "[Privacy Enhancements](https://web.archive.org/web/20240209182901/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/how-turn-googles-privacy-sandbox-ad-tracking-and-why-you-should)"** - Rather than safeguarding user privacy, Google’s new "Sandbox" merely shifts control over the advertising ecosystem to Google.
- **[Web Environment Integrity](https://web.archive.org/web/20240118070109/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Environment_Integrity)** - Thankfully abandoned in November 2023.
- **[Abandonment of Nest Renew Energy Impact Program](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/10956849?hl=en&ref_topic=11112728)** - The program was promising, but its quick demise shows the fleeting nature of Google's non-core initiatives.

## A Beautiful Beginning

In 2004 I was in my senior year at college working an IT help desk job. A coworker’s eBay purchase led to my first Gmail invite—a symbol of Google’s meteoric rise.

Gmail’s advent redefined email, and for two decades, my Gmail address became a digital anchor amid the online chaos. Chrome’s debut and Android OS further solidified my bond with Google. 

Fast forward, and the once-clear divide between Android and iOS has blurred, and I now bid farewell to Google, holding onto nostalgia for its early days.

## The Breakup Process

In 2021, I experimented with Safari as my main browser, which led me to stop automatically uploading photos to Google Photos. I eventually moved to iCloud Photos, with a backup in [Immich](https://immich.app/).

The tough breakups were Google Domains, Google Home/Nest, YouTube, and YouTube TV:

- **Google Domains:** Moved to CloudFlare, aligned with my values of simplicity.
- **Google Home/Nest:** I still use these but also have them set up through [HomeBridge](https://homebridge.io).
- **YouTube:** Using [Invidious](http://inv.tux.pizza/) as an alternative.
- **YouTube TV:** Retained for its robust live TV offerings.

Now, it’s Gmail and Google Search left to address. I've started tracking migration progress and moving only essential contacts.

## A Tangent on Passwords

Web browsers made password management easy but led me to use Bitwarden for more security. The rise of [passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) signals a new era, and Safari/iCloud now handle all my pass* related tasks.

## The Nail in the Coffin

In early 2024, IDX revealed my Gmail in a recent leak. This pushed me to adopt unique email identifiers and leverage iCloud+’s email generator.

## All Your Eggs in One Basket?

While this may read like a love letter to Apple, I’m wary of overreliance on any one company. I aim for a tech landscape defined by choice, transparency, and ethical integrity.
