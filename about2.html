      <p>The IT industry should be a force for good, but if not kept in check, can overreach the purpose it is intended to serve. I take the responsibility granted to me as an endpoint engineer very seriously, and offer this page as my commitment to both individuals and the institution I work for to keep personal privacy and the security of our work environment in focus simultaneously.</p>

      <h1>CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS</h1>
      <p>Generally, IT Engineers have access to persons' electronic information, some of which may be personal and confidential, such as employee ID and email address. This generally occurs when troubleshooting an issue directly with the account holder. In other instances, accessing this electronic information should only be performed when necessary and permission has been granted by proper employer and legal authorities.</p>
      <p>Endpoint Engineers can remotely configure computer settings. This generally occurs when preparing a device to meet security protocols, in effort to protect against threats such as attacks, malware, and viruses, as well as to protect the integrity and security of information.</p>
      <p>Some security protocols may be considered inconvenient; they should be reviewed to ensure they are essential and only then activated with as little of a disruption as possible.</p>
